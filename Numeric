* There are three types in Numeric Data Type,
    1. Integer(int- 3)
    2. Float(float- 3.6)
    3. Complex(complex- 3+6j)

* Integer has no limit, which means it is unlimited unlike java.

* We can convert an integer into float or complex, same goes to float but we can't convert a complex data type into int
or float. This conversion is known as CASTING. And we can convert to strings also.
    For Example,
    Conversion of int to float & complex:    Conversion of float to int & complex:     Conversion of float & int to str:
    a = 3                                    a = 3.0                                   a= 3.0
    b = float(a)                             b = int(a)                                b= 6
    print(b)       #output: 3.0              print(b)       #output: 3                 print(str(a), str(b))
    c = complex(a)                           c = complex(a)                            #output: 3.0, 6
    print(c)       #output: 3+0j             print(c)       #output: 3+0j

* Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that
 can be used to make random numbers:
    For Example,
    print(random.randrange(2,8)) #output: This changes after every run as after you print this this gives random number
    between 2 and 8.
