* Lists are collection of data in a single variable.
   For Example,
   Alphabets = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

* Lists are mutable, ordered and allow duplicate values.

* In Lists, we can use multiple data types.
   For Example,
   list = ['P', "SuvarnaShiva", 3, 6.0, 7+14j]

* The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).

* Reverse and Reversed method do print the given variable in reverse but they are different. Reveres method changes the
  given list like, l = [3,6,9]                whereas, reversed method does not change the list and returns as an
                   print(l.reverse())         iterable object where you can use it with anything like tuples,string,sets.
                   # Output: [9,6,3]          Like, l = [3,6,9]
                                                    new_l = reversed(list(l))
                                                    print(new_l)
                                                    # Output: [9,6,3]

* By default, pop method removes only the last element. While using pop method you have to give the range by
  index position.

* And for taking multiple inputs from user we use lists as follows:
  We can use two methods: Split Method, List Comprehension
  Split method:
  Here, we use map for iteration instead of loops(which takes more steps than map)
  a = list(map(int,input("Enter your lucky numbers:").split()))
  print("My lucky Numbers are:", a)
  List Comprehension:
  b = [int(b) for b in input("The numbers of the Winners are:").split()]
  print("The Lottery Winners are:", b)

* Sorting is case sensitive, uppercase get printed first along lowercase.

* To print the sorted list as it is, then we have to use thislist.sort(key = str.lower) (Here, thislist is a list).

* Copying lists we have to use the builtin functions otherwise the changes happened to the parent list will reflect in
  child list as well. For more details, check the code in lists class file. We can use two built-in functions:
  a. Make a copy of a list with the copy() method.    b. Make a copy of a list with the list() method.

* Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists.

    Method	        Description
    append()	    Adds an element at the end of the list
    clear()	        Removes all the elements from the list
    copy()	        Returns a copy of the list
    count()	        Returns the number of elements with the specified value
    extend()	    Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
    index()	        Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
    insert()	    Adds an element at the specified position
    pop()	        Removes the element at the specified position
    remove()	    Removes the item with the specified value
    reverse()	    Reverses the order of the list
