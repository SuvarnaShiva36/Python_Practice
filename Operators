* This is the precedence of the operators in python

Operator	                Description

**	                        Exponentiation
+x, -x, ~x	                Unary plus, Unary minus, Bitwise NOT
*, /, //, %	                Multiplication, Division, Floor division, Modulus
+, -	                    Addition, Subtraction
<<, >>	                    Bitwise shift operators
&	                        Bitwise AND
^	                        Bitwise XOR
|	                        Bitwise OR
==, !=, >, >=, <, <=,       is, is not, in, not in	Comparisons, Identity, Membership operators
not	                        Logical NOT
and	                        Logical AND
or	                        Logical OR

* When the precedence is same like addition and subtraction have the same precedence, then the given code is executed from
left to right except for exponential form it is executed from right to left
For example:
1. print(5+3-6)             2. print(3**2**2)
Output will be :            Output will be :
(5+3)-6 that is 2           3**(2**2)that is 81
