* Boolean contains only two: True, False

* If the given condition or statement is true then it will return true else false.

* Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content:
  Any string is True, except empty strings.
  Any number is True, except 0.
  Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.
  For Example,
  print("True")
  print({3,6,9})

* In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0,
  and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.
  For Example,
  print("False")
  print([])
  print({})
  print(())
  print('')
  print("")
  print(0)
  print(None)
